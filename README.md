# Hello World! 
- My name is Luiz Costa and I'm Brazilian.
- For many years I used to work in Hospitality as a Chef de Partie, but I've decided to change completely and now here I am.
- I'm currently enrolled at **42sp** to become a Software Engineer. I'm learning C at 42sp and HTML, CSS3 & JavaScript by myself.
- If you want to reach me out, send me an e-mail: luuiz.costa@hotmail.com
